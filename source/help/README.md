The help is available on your website as `http://website/help/`. The help gives you more information about how to create small web pages, blogs and wikis. It's recommended to also install the [toc extension](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/toc) and [highlight extension](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/highlight).

## How to edit the help

You can edit the help in a web browser or on your computer. If you want to edit the help on your computer, have a look inside your `content/9-help` folder. Upload your changes to GitHub and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for `datenstrom/yellow-extensions`.

If you want to make a translation, here are some tips. Translate the title and content of all pages. The file names should be left unchanged.
