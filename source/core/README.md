## How to edit a website on the computer

You can use your favorite text editor and change everything in the file manager. All content is located in your `content` folder. Basically, what you see in the file manager is the website you get. You can [use the built-in web server](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/command#how-to-use-the-built-in-web-server) or [build a static website](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/command#how-to-build-a-static-website).

## How to customise a website on the computer

If you want to adjust the content, then use [Markdown](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/markdown). All content is located in your `content` folder. Create the file `content/shared/header.md` for a header. Create the file `content/shared/footer.md` for a footer. You can also create a header and footer in any other folder, then it will only be shown on pages in the same folder.

If you want to adjust HTML, then change the layout. The default layout is defined in file `system/extensions/yellow-system.ini`. A different layout can be defined in the [settings](#settings) at the top of each page, for example `Layout: default`. All layout files are stored in your `system/layouts` folder. There's an [API for developers](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/help), for example to create your own navigation.

If you want to adjust CSS, then change the theme. The default theme is defined in file `system/extensions/yellow-system.ini`. A different theme can be defined in the [settings](#settings) at the top of each page, for example `Theme: stockholm`. Strictly speaking, themes consist not only of CSS but of multiple files. All theme files are stored in your `system/themes` folder. There are [themes](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions#themes) to download.

## How to make a multilingual website

Your website comes with three languages and you can install more [languages](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions#languages). The default language is defined in file `system/extensions/yellow-system.ini`. A different language can be defined in the [settings](#settings) at the top of each page, for example `Language: en`.

If you want to translate the entire website into multiple languages, then enable the multi language mode. Open file `system/extensions/yellow-system.ini` and change `CoreMultiLanguageMode: 1`. Then you have to adjust the [folder structure](#folders). Go to your `content` folder and create a new folder for each language.

If you want to configure languages, then change the language settings. Open file `system/extensions/yellow-language.ini` and change existing settings. You can copy the [default settings from language files](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/blob/master/source/english/english.txt) and paste them into this file. You can also add your own language settings, for example image captions.

## How to hide a page

Set `Status: unlisted` in the [settings](#settings) at the top of a page. The page is no longer visible in navigation and search results. You can choose between different [status values](#settings-status), to control who can see and access a page.

## How to redirect a page

Set `Redirect` in the [settings](#settings) at the top of a page. The page is redirected to another page or URL. You can continue to edit the page in the [web browser](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/edit) and the file system.

## Examples

Content file with normal page:

    ---
    Title: Normal page
    ---
    This is an example page.

Content file with unlisted page:

    ---
    Title: Unlisted page
    Status: unlisted
    ---
    This page is not visible in navigation and search results.

Content file with redirection:

    ---
    Title: Redirect page
    Redirect: https://datenstrom.se/yellow/
    ---
    This page is redirected to another page.

Content file with excluded page:

    ---
    Title: Example page
    Build: exclude
    ---
    This page is not included in static website.
